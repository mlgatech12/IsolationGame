However, any agent that searches deeper with the same algorithm probably has a bigger advantage. You may learn about a method that allows your algorithm to search in such a way that you can find the maximum search depth without running out of time. This will probably come up in class or you can read through the book to find out what you are looking for.\n",
    "    - Next to beat is the agent with iterative deepening. This one is a little harder to think about, given that you may have used all the tools that you may think of to try a make a \"better\" agent. But you may have just implemented the evaluation function that was discussed in class. Maybe we can do better - like checking for winning moves and prioritizing those! Or if you are feeling really creative, you can always try editing the `CustomEvalFn` below this cell and come up with an awesome idea of your own.\n",
    "    - Now to Peter's agent with the secret evaluation function. Here we have nothing to tell you. Use everything in your toolbox and within the class rules to defeat it. This is by far the hardest 5 points to get! Good luck and have fun!\n",
